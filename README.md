Introduction to Data Structures - Homework 2

In this assignment, I implemented a unique linked list which is a doubly-linked list with dummy nodes for the head and tail.

The purpose of this assignment was:
- to practice working with a linked data structure
- to become intimately familiar with the List and ListIterator interfaces
