Introduction to Data Structures - Homework 3

The objective of this exercise was to reconstruct/unzip a message archived with a binary-tree-based algorithm. The program asks for a single filename at the start: "Please enter filename to decode: ", decode the message in the file and print it out to the console. 

The file consists of two or three lines: the first one or two lines contain the encoding scheme, and the second or third line contains the archived message. 

Thus, this project contains the decoder MsgTree.java and 4 compressed message files that end in ".arch", for example, monalisa.arch.
