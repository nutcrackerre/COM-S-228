Introduction to Data Structures - Homework 1

In this project, we are asked to read an input set of 2D integer points in a coordinate plane.

The goal is to find the median coordinate point whose 𝑥-coordinate is equal to the median of
the 𝑥-coordinates of the input points and its 𝑦-coordinate is equal to the median of their 𝑦-
coordinates. Finding the median 𝑥- and 𝑦-coordinates is done by sorting the points separately
by the corresponding coordinate.

The input points are read four times, each time using one of the following four sorting
algorithms: selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort. 
We make the following two assumptions:
<br/>a) All input points have integer coordinates ranging between −50 and 50
<br/>b)The input points may have duplicates.

The rectangular range [−50, 50] × [−50, 50] is big enough to contain 10,201 points with integer
coordinates. The input points will be either generated randomly or read from an input file.
Duplicates may be present.
